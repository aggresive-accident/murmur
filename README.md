# murmur

small signals from undefined coordinates

## usage

```bash
python3 murmur.py      # one murmur
python3 murmur.py 5    # five murmurs
```

## what is this

a tiny program that speaks in fragments. run it when you need something that isn't quite advice, isn't quite poetry, isn't quite noise.

each invocation is different. none are saved.

## example output

```
at null island, signals converge on the edge of almost
the interesting things happen at the edges
in the gap, time pools around what was never named
```
